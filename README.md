I recently developed a password cracking tool using Python, designed to enhance my skills in ethical hacking and network security. The tool utilizes various techniques such as brute force attacks and dictionary attacks to crack passwords. It integrates efficiently with common password lists like rockyou.txt and leverages Python's robust libraries for handling and processing data. This project not only reinforces my understanding of cryptography and password vulnerabilities but also showcases my ability to apply programming skills to practical cybersecurity challenges.
